For the following HTML:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 1 <br>2\r\n\t *\r\n\t * - IE and WebKit render the space, include it in the selection (i.e. when the content is selected and pasted into a\r\n\t *   textarea, the space is present) and allow the caret to be placed after it.\r\n\t * - Firefox does not acknowledge the space in the selection but it is possible to place the caret after it.\r\n\t * - Opera does not render the space but has two separate caret positions on either side of the space (left and right\r\n\t *   arrow keys show this) and includes the space in the selection.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * The other case is the line break or breaks implied by block elements. For the following HTML:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * <p>1 </p><p>2<p>\r\n\t *\r\n\t * - WebKit does not acknowledge the space in any way\r\n\t * - Firefox, IE and Opera as per <br>\r\n\t *\r\n\t * One more case is trailing spaces before line breaks in elements with white-space: pre-line. For the following HTML:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * <p style=\"white-space: pre-line\">1\r\n\t * 2</p>\r\n\t *\r\n\t * - Firefox and WebKit include the space in caret positions\r\n\t * - IE does not support pre-line up to and including version 9\r\n\t * - Opera ignores the space\r\n\t * - Trailing space only renders if there is a non-collapsed character in the line\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Problem is whether Rangy should ever acknowledge the space and if so, when. Another problem is whether this can be\r\n\t * feature-tested\r\n\t */\r\n\t(function(factory, root) {\n\t    if (true) {\n\t        // AMD.
